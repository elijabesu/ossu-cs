# Tuples
Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values: 

```
>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
```

## Tuples are immutable
Tuples are also comparable and hashable so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as key values in Python dictionaries.

Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element:

```
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
>>> print(t[0])
'a'
```

But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error:

```
>>> t[0] = 'A'
TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment
```

You can’t modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple with another:

```
>>> t = ('A',) + t[1:]
>>> print(t)
('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
```

The following will result in AttributeError:
- `t.sort()`
- `t.append(5)`
- `t.reverse()`

## Tuple assignment
One of the unique syntactic features of the Python language is the ability to have a tuple on the left side of an assignment statement. This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time when the left side is a sequence.

```
>>> (x, y) = (4, "fred")
>>> print(y)
'fred'
```

It can also be a function that returns multiple things, such as `split`:

```
>>> email = "ellie@saurich.com"
>>> username, domain = email.split("@")
>>> print(username)
ellie
>>> print(domain)
saurich.com
```

## Comparing tuples
The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences. Python starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if they are really big).

```
>>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)
True
>>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)
True
```

## Dictionaries and tuples
Dictionaries have a method called items that returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:

```
>>> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
>>> t = list(d.items())
>>> print(t)
[('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]
```

As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order.

However, since the list of tuples is a list, and tuples are comparable, we can now sort the list of tuples. Converting a dictionary to a list of tuples is a way for us to output the contents of a dictionary sorted by key:

```
>>> t.sort()
>>> t
[('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]
```

### Sort by values instead of keys
We first make a list of tuples where each tuple is `(value, key)`. The `items` method would give us a list of `(key, value)` tuples, but this time we want to sort by value, not key. Once we have constructed the list with the value-key tuples, it is a simple matter to sort the list in reverse order and print out the new, sorted list.

```
>>> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
>>> l = list()
>>> for key, val in d.items() :
...     l.append( (val, key) )
...
>>> l
[(10, 'a'), (22, 'c'), (1, 'b')]
>>> l.sort(reverse=True)
>>> l
[(22, 'c'), (10, 'a'), (1, 'b')]
```

## Glossary
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **comparable** | A type where one value can be checked to see if it is greater than, less than, or equal to another value of the same type. Types which are comparable can be put in a list and sorted. |
| **data structure** | A collection of related values, often organized in lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc. |
| **DSU** | Abbreviation of “decorate-sort-undecorate”, a pattern that involves building a list of tuples, sorting, and extracting part of the result. |
| **gather** | The operation of assembling a variable-length argument tuple. |
| **hashable** | A type that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers, floats, and strings are hashable; mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not. |
| **scatter** | The operation of treating a sequence as a list of arguments. |
| **shape (of a data structure)** | A summary of the type, size, and composition of a data structure. |
| **singleton** | A list (or other sequence) with a single element. |
| **tuple** | An immutable sequence of elements. |
| **tuple assignment** | An assignment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of variables on the left. The right side is evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the variables on the left. |
