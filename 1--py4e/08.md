## Glossary
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **aliasing** | A circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object. |
| **delimiter** | A character or string used to indicate where a string should be split. |
| **element** | One of the values in a list (or other sequence); also called items. |
| **equivalent** | Having the same value. |
| **index** | An integer value that indicates an element in a list. |
| **identical** | Being the same object (which implies equivalence). |
| **list** | A sequence of values. |
| **list traversal** | The sequential accessing of each element in a list. |
| **nested list** | A list that is an element of another list. |
| **object** | Something a variable can refer to. An object has a type and a value. |
| **reference** | The association between a variable and its value. |

### Lists are mutable
Unlike strings, lists are mutable because you can change the order of items in a list or reassign an item in a list. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.

```
>>> numbers = [17, 123]
>>> numbers[1] = 5
>>> print(numbers)
[17, 5]
```

### List slices
The slice operator also works on lists:

```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3]
['b', 'c']
>>> t[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> t[3:]
['d', 'e', 'f']
```

If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.

```
>>> t[:]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:

```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
>>> print(t)
['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

### List methods
Most list methods are void; they modify the list and return None. 

`append` adds a new element to the end of a list;
`extend` takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements;
`sort` arranges the elements of the list from low to high;

`pop` deletes an element of provided index, modifies the list and returns the element that was removed (if you donâ€™t provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element);
`del` is the same as `pop` but doesn't return the value;
`remove` deletes a provided element (if you don't know the index), the return value from remove is None;

To remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index:

```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> del t[1:5]
>>> print(t)
['a', 'f']
```

You can call `split` with an optional argument called a delimiter that specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. 

```
>>> s = 'spam-spam-spam'
>>> delimiter = '-'
>>> s.split(delimiter)
['spam', 'spam', 'spam']
```

`join` is the inverse of `split`. It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. `join` is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:

```
>>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']
>>> delimiter = ' '
>>> delimiter.join(t)
'pining for the fjords'
```
