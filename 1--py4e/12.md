# Networked Programs
*Developer console*: right click on a page -> Inspect -> Network -> Ctrl+R -> the doc I am interested in -> Headers

`ord()` tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character

ASCII only has 128 characters

UTF-8 overlaps with ASCII, has 1-4 bytes

type `bytes` are raw characters

### Python strings to bytes
When we talk to an external resource, we need to encode Python 3 strings into a given character encoding. Likewise when we read data, we need to decode.

`decode()` turns bytes (UTF-8 or ASCII) into unicode (string)

`encode()` turns strings into bytes (UTF-8)

## Web Scraping
- when a program or script pretends to be a browser and retrieves web pages, looks at those web pages, extracts information, and then looks at more web pages
- search engines scrape web pages (also called spidering/crawling the web)

## Parsing Web Pages
- html is nastyyyyyy so we need to parse it to be pretty and readable (regex doesn't always work bc html has a LOT of syntax errors bc ppl stoopid)
- library **Beautiful Soup** is for exactly that
- you need to install BS4 first, either on the PC for everyone OR put it in the same folder that your code is in: http://www.py4e.com/code3/bs4.zip

## Glossary
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **BeautifulSoup** | A Python library for parsing HTML documents and extracting data from HTML documents that compensates for most of the imperfections in the HTML that browsers generally ignore. You can download the BeautifulSoup code from www.crummy.com. |
| **port** | A number that generally indicates which application you are contacting when you make a socket connection to a server. As an example, web traffic usually uses port 80 while email traffic uses port 25. |
| **scrape** | When a program pretends to be a web browser and retrieves a web page, then looks at the web page content. Often programs are following the links in one page to find the next page so they can traverse a network of pages or a social network. |
| **socket** | A network connection between two applications where the applications can send and receive data in either direction. |
| **spider** | The act of a web search engine retrieving a page and then all the pages linked from a page and so on until they have nearly all of the pages on the Internet which they use to build their search index. |
