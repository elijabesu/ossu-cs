# Python and Web Services
Wire Protocol - what we send on the wire (across the net) - how the data leaves one system (f.e. Python), transits a network, and enters another system (f.e. Java)

**XML** (older) and **JSON** (lighter)

## eXtensible Markup Language - XML
XML looks very similar to HTML, but XML is more structured than HTML. Here is a sample of an XML document:

```
<person>
  <name>Chuck</name>
  <phone type="intl">
    +1 734 303 4456
  </phone>
  <email hide="yes" />
</person>
```

Each pair of opening (f.e. `<person>`) and closing tags (f.e. `</person>`) represents an *element* or *node* with the same name as the tag (f.e. `person`). Each element can have some text, some attributes (f.e. `hide`), and other nested elements. If an XML element is empty, then it may be depicted by a self-closing tag (f.e. `<email />`).

Often it is helpful to think of an XML document as a tree structure where there is a top element, and other tags are drawn as children of their parent elements.

XML does not care about indentation.
