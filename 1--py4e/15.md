# Databases
A *database* is a file that is organized for storing data. Most databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends. Because a database is stored on permanent storage, it can store far more data than a dictionary, which is limited to the size of the memory in the computer.

Like a dictionary, database software is designed to keep the inserting and accessing of data very fast, even for large amounts of data. Database software maintains its performance by building indexes as data is added to the database to allow the computer to jump quickly to a particular entry.

There are many different database systems which are used for a wide variety of purposes including: Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. We focus on SQLite in this book because it is a very common database and is already built into Python. SQLite is designed to be embedded into other applications to provide database support within the application. For example, the Firefox browser also uses the SQLite database internally as do many other products.

## Database concepts
When you first look at a database it looks like a spreadsheet with multiple sheets. The primary data structures in a database are: *tables*, *rows*, and *columns*. In technical descriptions of relational databases the concepts of table, row, and column are more formally referred to as *relation*, *tuple*, and *attribute*, respectively.

- *database* contains many tables
- *relation* contains tuples and attributes
- *tuple* is a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track
- *attribute* is one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row

A relation is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and columns. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.

## Glossary
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **attribute** | One of the values within a tuple. More commonly called a “column” or “field”. |
| **constraint** | When we tell the database to enforce a rule on a field or a row in a table. A common constraint is to insist that there can be no duplicate values in a particular field (i.e., all the values must be unique). |
| **cursor** | A cursor allows you to execute SQL commands in a database and retrieve data from the database. A cursor is similar to a socket or file handle for network connections and files, respectively. |
| **database browser** | A piece of software that allows you to directly connect to a database and manipulate the database directly without writing a program. |
| **foreign key** | A numeric key that points to the primary key of a row in another table. Foreign keys establish relationships between rows stored in different tables. |
| **index** | Additional data that the database software maintains as rows and inserts into a table to make lookups very fast. |
| **logical key** | A key that the “outside world” uses to look up a particular row. For example in a table of user accounts, a person’s email address might be a good candidate as the logical key for the user’s data. |
| **normalization** | Designing a data model so that no data is replicated. We store each item of data at one place in the database and reference it elsewhere using a foreign key. |
| **primary key** | A numeric key assigned to each row that is used to refer to one row in a table from another table. Often the database is configured to automatically assign primary keys as rows are inserted. |
| **relation** | An area within a database that contains tuples and attributes. More typically called a “table”. |
| **tuple** | A single entry in a database table that is a set of attributes. More typically called “row”. |
