# Strings

## Slicing
A segment of a string is called a slice. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:

```python
>>> s = 'Monty Python'
>>> print(s[0:5])
Monty
>>> print(s[6:12])
Python
```

The operator returns the part of the string from the "n-th" character to the "m-th" character, including the first but excluding the last.

If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:

```python
>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[:3]
'ban'
>>> fruit[3:]
'ana'
```

## Strings are immutable
You can’t change an existing string.

```python
>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'
>>> greeting[0] = 'J'
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

## Methods
`dir()` will list the methods available for an object. OR just read the [docs](https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

## Format operator
`%d` means that the second operand should be formatted as an integer ("d" stands for "decimal"):

```python
>>> camels = 42
>>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels
'I have spotted 42 camels.'
```

The following example uses %d to format an integer, %g to format a floating-point number (don’t ask why), and %s to format a string:

```python
>>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')
'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.'
```

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **counter** | A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and then incremented. |
| **empty string** | A string with no characters and length 0, represented by two quotation marks. |
| **format operator** | An operator, %, that takes a format string and a tuple and generates a string that includes the elements of the tuple formatted as specified by the format string. |
| **format sequence** | A sequence of characters in a format string, like %d, that specifies how a value should be formatted. |
| **format string** | A string, used with the format operator, that contains format sequences. |
| **flag** | A boolean variable used to indicate whether a condition is true or false. |
| **invocation** | A statement that calls a method. |
| **immutable** | The property of a sequence whose items cannot be assigned. |
| **index** | An integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as a character in a string. |
| **item** | One of the values in a sequence. |
| **method** | A function that is associated with an object and called using dot notation. |
| **object** | Something a variable can refer to. For now, you can use “object” and “value” interchangeably. |
| **search** | A pattern of traversal that stops when it finds what it is looking for. |
| **sequence** | An ordered set; that is, a set of values where each value is identified by an integer index. |
| **slice** | A part of a string specified by a range of indices. |
| **traverse** | To iterate through the items in a sequence, performing a similar operation on each. |
