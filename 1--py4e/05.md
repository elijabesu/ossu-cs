# Iterations

## Continue vs Break
`continue` will skip to the next iteration without finishing the body of the loop for the current iteration;

`break` will exit the loop completely.

```
while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line[0] == '#':
        continue
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
print('Done!')
```

The code above will result in this:

```
> hello there
hello there
> # don't print this
> print this!
print this!
> done
Done!
```

| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **accumulator** | A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result. |
| **counter** | A variable used in a loop to count the number of times something happened. We initialize a counter to zero and then increment the counter each time we want to “count” something. |
| **decrement** | An update that decreases the value of a variable. |
| **initialize** | An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated. |
| **increment** | An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one). |
| **infinite loop** | A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied or for which there is no terminating condition. |
| **iteration** | Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a function that calls itself or a loop. |
