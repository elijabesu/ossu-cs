# Dictionaries
You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called keys) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a key-value pair or sometimes an item.

`len` returns the number of key-value pairs

`in` operator tells you whether something appears as a key in the dictionary

To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method `values`, which returns the values as a type that can be converted to a list, and then use the in operator:

```
>>> vals = list(eng2sp.values())
>>> 'uno' in vals
True
```

`get` that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, get returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value.

```
word = 'brontosaurus'
d = dict()
for c in word:
    d[c] = d.get(c,0) + 1
print(d)
```

## Glossary
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **dictionary** | A mapping from a set of keys to their corresponding values. |
| **hashtable** | The algorithm used to implement Python dictionaries. |
| **hash function** | A function used by a hashtable to compute the location for a key. |
| **histogram** | A set of counters. |
| **implementation** | A way of performing a computation. |
| **item** | Another name for a key-value pair. |
| **key** | An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of a key-value pair. |
| **key-value pair** | The representation of the mapping from a key to a value. |
| **lookup** | A dictionary operation that takes a key and finds the corresponding value. |
| **nested loops** | When there are one or more loops “inside” of another loop. The inner loop runs to completion each time the outer loop runs once. |
| **value** | An object that appears in a dictionary as the second part of a key-value pair. This is more specific than our previous use of the word “value”. |
