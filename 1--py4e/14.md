# Object-oriented programming
**Class** defines the abstract characters of a thing (object), incl. characteristics (attributes, fields or properties) and behaviours (methods, operations or features). Class is theoretically a blueprint for objects.

**Instance** is the actual object created at runtime. The set of values of the attrivutes of a particular object is calles its state. The object consists of state and the behaviour that's defined in the object's class.

**Method** is object's abilities. In language, methods are verbs. Within the program, using a method usually affects only one particular object.

## Using objects
As it turns out, we have been using objects all along in this book. Python provides us with many built-in objects. Here is some simple code where the first few lines should feel very simple and natural to you.

```
stuff = list()
stuff.append('python')
stuff.append('chuck')
stuff.sort()
print (stuff[0])
print (stuff.__getitem__(0))
print (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))
```

The first line constructs an object of type list, the second and third lines call the `append()` method, the fourth line calls the `sort()` method, and the fifth line retrieves the item at position 0. The sixth line calls the `__getitem__()` method in the stuff list with a parameter of zero. The seventh line is an even more verbose way of retrieving the 0th item in the list.

```
print (list.__getitem__(stuff,0))
```

In this code, we call the `__getitem__` method in the list class and pass the list and the item we want retrieved from the list as parameters.

We can take a look at the capabilities of an object by looking at the output of the `dir()` function:

```
>>> stuff = list()
>>> dir(stuff)
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__',
'__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__',
'__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__',
'__gt__', '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__',
'__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__',
'__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__',
'__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__',
'__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',
'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index',
'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']
```

## Our first Python object
An object can contain a number of functions (*methods*) as well as data (*attributes*) that is used by those functions.

We use the `class` keyword to define the data and code that will make up each of the objects. The class keyword includes the name of the class and begins an indented block of code where we include the attributes (data) and methods (code).

```
class PartyAnimal:
   x = 0

   def party(self) :
     self.x = self.x + 1
     print("So far",self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()
an.party()
an.party()
an.party()
PartyAnimal.party(an)
``` 

Each method looks like a function, starting with the `def` keyword and consisting of an indented block of code. This object has one attribute (`x`) and one method (`party`). The methods have a special first parameter that we name by convention `self` (but can be anything).

Just as the `def` keyword does not cause function code to be executed, the `class` keyword does not create an object. Instead, the `class` keyword defines a template indicating what data and code will be contained in each object of type `PartyAnimal`. 

`an = PartyAnimal()` creates an object or instance of the class `PartyAnimal`. Python constructs the object with the right data and methods and returns the object which is then assigned to the variable `an`. 

When the `PartyAnimal` class is used to construct an object, the variable `an` is used to point to that object. We use `an` to access the code and data for that particular instance of the `PartyAnimal` class.

Each Partyanimal object/instance contains within it a variable `x` and a method/function named `party`.

When the `party` method is called, the first parameter (which we call by convention `self`) points to the particular instance of the PartyAnimal object that `party` is called from. Within the `party` method, we see the line:

```
self.x = self.x + 1
```

This syntax using the dot operator is saying '*the x within self*.'

`PartyAnimal.party(an)` is another way to call the party method within the an object. You can think of `an.party()` as shorthand for the above line.

## Classes as types
In Python all variables have a type.
```
class PartyAnimal:
   x = 0

   def party(self) :
     self.x = self.x + 1
     print("So far",self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()
print ("Type", type(an))
print ("Dir ", dir(an))
print ("Type", type(an.x))
print ("Type", type(an.party))
```

When this program executes, it produces the following output:

```
Type <class '__main__.PartyAnimal'>
Dir  ['__class__', '__delattr__', ...
'__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__',
'__weakref__', 'party', 'x']
Type <class 'int'>
Type <class 'method'>
```

## Object lifecycle
Usually, we don't think much about the creation and destruction of variables, but often as our objects become more complex, we need to take some action within the object to set things up as the object is constructed and possibly clean things up as the object is discarded.

If we want our object to be aware of these moments of construction and destruction, we add specially named methods to our object:

```
class PartyAnimal:
   x = 0

   def __init__(self):
     print('I am constructed')

   def party(self) :
     self.x = self.x + 1
     print('So far', self.x)

   def __del__(self):
     print('I am destructed', self.x)

an = PartyAnimal()
an.party()
an.party()
an = 42
print('an contains', an)
```

When this program executes, it produces the following output:

```
I am constructed
So far 1
So far 2
I am destructed 2
an contains 42
```

As Python constructs our object, it calls our `__init__` method to give us a chance to set up some default or initial values for the object. When Python encounters the line `an = 42`, it actually "thows our object away" so it can reuse the `an` variable to store the value `42`. Just at the moment when our `an` object is being "destroyed" our destructor code (`__del__`) is called. We cannot stop our variable from being destroyed, but we can do any necessary cleanup right before our object no longer exists.

## Multiple instances
When we construct multiple objects from our class, we might want to set up different initial values for each of the objects. We can pass data to the constructors to give each object a different initial value:
```
class PartyAnimal:
   x = 0
   name = ''

   def __init__(self, nam):
     self.name = nam
     print(self.name,'constructed')

   def party(self) :
     self.x = self.x + 1
     print(self.name,'party count',self.x)

s = PartyAnimal('Sally')
j = PartyAnimal('Jim')
```

## Inheritance
For this example, we move our `PartyAnimal` class into its own file. Then, we can "import" the `PartyAnimal` class in a new file and extend it, as follows:

```
from party import PartyAnimal

class CricketFan(PartyAnimal):
   points = 0

   def six(self):
      self.points = self.points + 6
      self.party()
      print(self.name,"points",self.points)

s = PartyAnimal("Sally")
s.party()
j = CricketFan("Jim")
j.party()
j.six()
print(dir(j))
```

When we define the `CricketFan` class, we indicate that we are extending the `PartyAnimal` class. This means that all of the variables (`x`) and methods (`party`) from the `PartyAnimal` class are inherited by the `CricketFan` class. For example, within the `six` method in the `CricketFan` class, we call the party method from the `PartyAnimal` class.

As the program executes, we create `s` and `j` as independent instances of `PartyAnimal` and `CricketFan`. The `j` object has additional capabilities beyond the s object.

```
Sally constructed
Sally party count 1
Jim constructed
Jim party count 1
Jim party count 2
Jim points 6
['__class__', '__delattr__', ... '__weakref__',
'name', 'party', 'points', 'six', 'x']
```

In the `dir` output for the `j` object (instance of the `CricketFan` class), we see that it has the attributes and methods of the parent class, as well as the attributes and methods that were added when the class was extended to create the `CricketFan` class.

## Glossary
| Name | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| **attribute** | A variable that is part of a class. |
| **class** | A template that can be used to construct an object. Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object. |
| **child class** | A new class created when a parent class is extended. The child class inherits all of the attributes and methods of the parent class. |
| **constructor** | An optional specially named method (`__init__`) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object. Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object. |
| **destructor** | An optional specially named method (`__del__`) that is called at the moment just before an object is destroyed. Destructors are rarely used.
| **inheritance** | When we create a new class (child) by extending an existing class (parent). The child class has all the attributes and methods of the parent class plus additional attributes and methods defined by the child class. |
| **method** | A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use 'message' instead of 'method' to describe this concept. |
| **object** | A constructed instance of a class. An object contains all of the attributes and methods that were defined by the class. Some object-oriented documentation uses the term 'instance' interchangeably with 'object'. |
| **parent class** | The class which is being extended to create a new child class. The parent class contributes all of its methods and attributes to the new child class. |
