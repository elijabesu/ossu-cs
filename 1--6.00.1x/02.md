# Core Elements of Programs
`range(start, end, increment)` or just `range(number)`

### for
- know number of iterations
- can end early via `break`
- uses a counter
- can rewrite a `for` loop using a `while` loop

### while
- unbounded number of iterations
- can end early via `break`
- can use a counter but must initialize before loop and increment it inside loop
- may not be able to rewrite a `while` loop using a `for` loop
