# Week 1: Python Basics

## 1. Introduction to Python
- An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.
- A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.
- The two things every computer can do are:
  - perform calculations
  - remember the results
- Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact.
- Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.
- A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.

Inside of the hardware machine, there are two elements:
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit**
  - it takes information from the memory, reads it in, does a primitive operation (subtraction, testing if it's true or false), then it typically stores stuff back in memory
- **Control Unit**
  - keeps track of what a specific operation I want to do in ALU at each point in time
  - inside, there is an important thing called a *program counter* - it points to the location of the first instruction, then changes according to the result
  - tells me where I am in a sequence of instructions

### Stored program computer
- sequence of *intructions stored* inside computer
  - built from predefined set of primitive instructions
    - arithmetic and logic
    - simple tests
    - moving data
- special program (interpreter) *executes each instruction in order*
  - use tests to change flow of control through sequence
  - stop when done

### Basic primitives
- Turing showed you can *compute anything* using 6 primitives
  - move left, move right, scan, read, write, do nothing
- modern programming languages have more convenient set of primitives
- can abstract methods to *create new primitives*
- anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming langauge - **Turing complete**

### Creating recipes
- a programming language provides a set of primitive *operations*
- *expressions* are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language
- expressions and computations have *values* and meanings in a programming language

### Aspects of languages
- **primitive constructs**
  - English: words
  - programming languages: numbers, strings, simple operators
- **syntax**
  - English: `cat dog boy` -> not syntactically valid ; `cat hugs boy` -> syntactically valid
  - programming languages: `"hi"5` -> not syntactically valid ; `3.2*5` -> syntactically valid
- **statis semantics** is which syntactically valid strings have meaning
  - English: `I are hungry` -> syntactically valid but static semantic error
  - programming languages: `3.2*5` -> syntactically valid ; `3+"hi"` -> static semantic error
- **semantics** is the meaning associated with a syntactically corrent string of symbols with no static semantic errors
  - English: can have many meanings
  - programming languages: have only one meaning but may not be what programmer intended

### Where things go wrong
- *syntactic errors*
  - common and easily caught
- *static semantic errors*
  - some languages check for these before running program (Python is NOT one of them)
  - can cause unpredictable behaviour
- no semantic errors but *different meaning than what programmer intended*
  - program crashes, stops running
  - program runs forever
  - program gives an answer but different than expected

### Python programs
- a **program** is a sequence of definitions and commands
  - definitions *evaluated*
  - commands *executed* by Python interpreter in a shell
- **commands** (statements) instruct interpreter to do something
- can be typed directly in a shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated

### Objects
- programs manipulate *data objects*
- objects have a *type* that defines the kinds of things program can do to them
- objects are
  - scalars (cannot be subdivided) - `int`, `float`, `bool`, `NoneType`
  - non-scalar (have internal structure that can be accessed)
